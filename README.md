<h2>Game Description - SpaceMan</h2>
<p>This is a game of Spaceman which is a spin on the original Hangman. For this game, the player gets an unknown word. The goal for the player is to guess all the correct letters in the word. They can choose what letter to select on the left side of the screen. They are allowed to make six mistakes on the seventh mistake the game is over. Every wrong letter that the player makes causes another missle to fall on the city and the city will blow up on the seventh mistake. If the player guesses all the letters right the city is safe and the words you win appear. If the player loses the city is on fire and the player sees the words you lose. After a few seconds of winning or losing the player is prompted if they would like to play again or not. </p>
